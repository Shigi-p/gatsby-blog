## 日本語超まとめ

運用フェーズに入った案件でいちいちdeploy走らせるのももったいないので、CDのymlフォルダの`on`を以下に書き換えて手動で実行しましょう

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## Introduction

I think many projects have CD which deploys built resources. And they run when pushed something to a specified branch.

The project has the same strategy. Built resources were deployed when we push something to develop branch.

A project was released, so the project is operation phase. I assume GitHub actions don’t run by trigger because it is increasing runtime for GitHub Actions.

## Adding a code to GitHub workflow

It is tooooo easy! You should replace `on` at your project’s deploy.yml file.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Then you can run GitHub workflow manually. 👍
